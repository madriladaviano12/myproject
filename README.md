# Template for a ZetaChain Hardhat Project

This is a simple Hardhat template that provides a starting point for developing smart contract applications on the ZetaChain blockchain.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your system.

## Getting Started

To get started, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn
```
ton./gi-ful(likto)
sabmit,

## Hardhat Tasks

This template includes two Hardhat tasks that can be used to generate a random wallet and request tokens from ZetaChain's faucet.

### Generating a Random Wallet

To generate a random wallet, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npx hardhat account --save
```

This will generate a random wallet, print information about the wallet to the terminal, and save the private key to a `.env` file to make it accessible to Hardhat. If you don't want to save the wallet (for example, if you just need an address to send tokens to), you can run the command without the `--save` flag.

### Requesting Tokens from the Faucet

To request tokens from ZetaChain's faucet using the account from the `.env` file, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npx hardhat faucet
```
